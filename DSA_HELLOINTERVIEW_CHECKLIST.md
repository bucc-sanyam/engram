# DSA Pattern Atlas — HelloInterview-style rewrite + diagram checklist

> Audit run 2026-07-20 via `npx tsx` importing `DSA_TOPICS` directly (not grep — grep undercounts because body strings use escaped `` \` `` fences). Ground truth: **150 problems total, 44 already have a `viz:*` diagram, 106 have none.** Confirms the gap the user flagged: most of the 150 individual question blogs render as prose-only, no visual.

## Target format per question (assumption — confirm/adjust before running the rewrite)

Current house style (`src/lib/dsa/topics/*.ts`, `problems[].body`) is a 6-beat narrative essay: **The problem. → The naive move. → The insight. → The walk-through. → Complexity. → The thread.** That's good prose but isn't the hellointerview.com shape. Proposed target structure per question — keep the existing prose voice, but reorganize/relabel so each of these is explicit and scannable:

1. **Signal** — the tell in the prompt that points at this pattern (what hellointerview calls out before anything else).
2. **Approach** — brute force framed briefly, then the optimal approach, each with its own Big-O (not just one "Complexity" line at the end).
3. **Diagram** — at least one `viz:*` block that visually walks the algorithm's state changes (not just prose narration of the walk-through).
4. **Complexity** — explicit final time/space line (keep).
5. **Thread** — the existing pattern-building link to the next problem (keep, it's a nice house touch hellointerview doesn't have).

This changes existing prose *structure/headers*, not just adds diagrams — every one of the 150 needs a pass, including the 44 that already have a diagram (their prose still uses the old 6-beat shape, not this one).

## How to use this checklist

Two independent checkboxes per problem:
- **[D]** = has a `viz:*` diagram
- **[R]** = body rewritten into the Signal/Approach/Diagram/Complexity/Thread shape above

Recommended execution: same pattern as the 2026-07-20 viz rollout — parallel background agents, one per chapter file (18 files = 18 agents, matches `src/lib/dsa/topics/*.ts`), each agent rewrites its own file's `intro` + all `problems[].body` and validates with `npx tsx scripts/validate-viz.mts src/lib/dsa/topics/<file>.ts` before finishing. Chapter intros also lack a diagram (all 18 show `intro viz: none`) — decide whether intros get the same treatment or stay as-is.

## Totals
- **150 problems**, **44 with a diagram (29%)**, **106 with none (71%)**
- **0 chapter intros** have a diagram (18/18 missing)
- **0 problems** currently use the proposed Signal/Approach/Diagram/Complexity/Thread structure — the rewrite pass `[R]` column is 100% open regardless of `[D]` status
- Worst-covered chapters (0 diagrams): **Intervals** (0/6)
- Best-covered: **Bit Manipulation** (2/7), **Sliding Window** (3/6), **Advanced Graphs** (2/6), **Backtracking** (3/10)

## Suggested next step
Don't implement yet per your ask — this is the checklist only. When ready: confirm the target format section above (especially whether chapter intros get a diagram too, and whether "Signal" callouts should reuse the `viz:*` fence system or be a plain markdown block), then run it the same way as the 2026-07-20 viz rollout — one background agent per chapter file, validated with `scripts/validate-viz.mts` before each finishes.
